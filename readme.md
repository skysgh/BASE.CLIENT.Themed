# Description ##

BASE is just a service, without any interface. Some form of interface is required. This is an example of one. 

It is a Themed Progressive Web App (PWA) Single Page Interface (SPA), built using common enterprise accessible technologies: 

* Angular
* Bootstrap


## Objectives ##

At a glance, the architecture is developed to achieve a number of technical objectives.

* use commonly accessible mature frameworks and technologies
* be relatively easily customisable to different sponsors
* capable of late-loading interface modules, from different sources than the base interface, based on a manifest.
  

## Background ##

* It wasn't started from scratch, and instead was built on the back of a commercially available theme:
