## 🔍 How to Find the Version

If you need to determine the exact version:

1. **Check ThemeForest purchase history:**
   - Log into ThemeForest
   - Go to Downloads
   - Find Velzon purchase - version shown there

2. **Check original ZIP filename:**
   - Look in `EXCLUDED/` folder (if ZIPs were kept)
   - Filename often contains version (e.g., `velzon-v1.5.0.zip`)

3. **Check theme files:**
   - Look for `CHANGELOG.md` in original theme package
   - Check `package.json` version field
   - Check theme's main SCSS file header comments

4. **Check online:**
   - Current version visible on ThemeForest page
   - Compare against features to estimate version

## ⚠️ Important Notes

From the main theme README:

> **IMPORTANT:**
> The zips and files **MUST** not be persisted (they take up some 400Mb). 
> Use the **EXCLUDED** folder for both downloaded zips and their expansions.

This means the original ZIP with version info may not be in the repo.
