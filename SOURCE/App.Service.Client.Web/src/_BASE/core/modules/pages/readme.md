Pages are full screen Views, at a parrallel or higher level than the contents of Apps Module
and all its child modules.

Pages include both private and public pages.

Most Pages are publicly accessible.

Public contains both late bound Information and Landing pages.

Late bound, as most people are not looking up for the following
Landing/Job oppportunities
Landing/DealsXYZ
Information/Privacy Concerns
Information/Legal
Information/Terms & Conditions
etc.

TODO: Whether Home is part of Information or Landing is to be decided.
