## Development Directions ##

`__BASE/shared` is the directory used for 
[models](./models/), 
[services](./services/), and 
[ui components](./ui/) 
that are common across all [custom apps](../apps/). 

The services, etc. are registered in a module, 
that is in turn imported by the [custom apps](../apps/) module.
