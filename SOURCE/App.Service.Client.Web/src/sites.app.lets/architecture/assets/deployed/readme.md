## Development Directives ##

Note:
To work correctly, Directory is defined as an asset directory in `angular.json`.


App/let specific assets (images, styles, scripts) are in this directory.

It is marked as an asset directory in the `angular.json` file so that 
it is copied to the `dist/` directory when the app is built.

See `resources/` subdirectory for data that will be moved to a datastore.
