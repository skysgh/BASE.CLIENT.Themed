# sites.app.lets/default

This folder contains **default business domain applets** that are typically needed by most applications.

These are distinguished from:
- **sites.app.parts/** - Platform/infrastructure applets (system-level)
- **Other applets in sites.app.lets/** - Domain-specific applets (education, employment, etc.)

## Contents

### social/
Social interaction features that many apps need:
- User profiles
- Connections/friends
- Groups (user-created groups)
- Messages
- Activity feeds

## Purpose

The `default/` grouping helps organize commonly-needed business capabilities that aren't platform-level (like settings, auth, compliance) but also aren't highly domain-specific (like education or employment modules).
