## Development Directives ##

Assets are first organised by open versus sensitive,
then static versus dynamic, 
then plural type (fonts, images, files, etc.)

In general static resources are generally open 
(eg: fonts, layout images, etc.)

Dynamic Images (products, etc.) that are not sensitive can
be open as well.

But other Dynamic Images (people) are generally placed
under sensitive (as they contain PI).
