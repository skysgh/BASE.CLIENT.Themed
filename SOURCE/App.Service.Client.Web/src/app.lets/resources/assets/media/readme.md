# Development Directives #

`artefacts` are for mutable images, etc. 
uploaded by end users for persistance 
in remote data blob stores
(one open to the public, one that requires
authentication to retrieve).

The difference with `assets` is that they 
are immutable images that are part of the code base.

Note:
a few files are in the code base but only for 
demo/first run purposes.
