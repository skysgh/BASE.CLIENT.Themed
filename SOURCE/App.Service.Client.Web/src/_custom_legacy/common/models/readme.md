## Development Directions ##

This folder is for models (ie, entities) that are required, 
but not part of a single custom app.

Examples would be:
* system models:
  * sponsor info
  * developer info
  * support info
  * statements info
  * user info
  * user system preferences (although this will have to link to specific app settings to)
* common functionality models:
  * searchsummaryitem
