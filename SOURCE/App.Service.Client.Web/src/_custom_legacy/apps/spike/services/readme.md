## Development Directions ##

Each app's `service` folder is for services specific to this app.

**Note:**
Any service that requires spanning multiple apps needs to be defined
in the [common services](../../../common/services/) directory.

The services consume and return either this app's [models](../models/)
or [common models](../../../common/models).
