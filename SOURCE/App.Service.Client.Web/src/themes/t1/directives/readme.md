## Developement Directives ##

Not much to say here - just a module that defines
and exports directives. 

It's imported by `BaseThemesV1CommonModule`
which is imported by most controls of the themed site. 

**TODO:**
I doubt that these directives are theme specific, but 
need to look at the impact more closely before moving them
to `v0/ (portable)`.
