## Development Directives ##

These are components used within the layout's header, side, footer, and 
not intended for inclusion on pages.

Includes:

* language selection control shown on header.
* signup/in control shown on header, that directs users to views for signing in/up.

TODO:
Currently intended for inclusion on every page, therefore not in this 
folder -- but *should* be moved here include:

* breadcrumbs shown (at top of every page?)
* footer component shown below every page.
* social media component links shown within footer
* cookie alert component shown over pages

A reason is that a view developer should not have to remember to include them
to get a persistent appearance (especially breadcrumbs, page hearders, footers).
